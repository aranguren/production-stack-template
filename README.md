# Purpose

This is a project template that provides a production-ready reference 
implementation for commonly used features: 

  * Reverse-proxy with automatic HTTPS encryption via LetsEncrypt 

If you follow [my blog](https://www.example.com) then you will know that
I am a big believer in Django and a supporting ecosystem around
that framework. 

**Principles**
  * 12-factor ready
  * Simplicity, with a path forward for scaling the parts you need.
  * Single developer friendly
  * Single machine friendly
  * Optimize for developer speed

**Docker**
  * building and running locally
  * building and running remotely
  * pushing to private repo
  * docker-compose local
  * docker-compose production
    * with docker labels
    
**Django**
  * my patterns for config/ folder
  * pickup environment vars from `.env` in `settings.py` file
  * support libraries (see blog)

Minimal Javascript (because I dont like it)
  * This is a personal thing. 

Traefik configuration for the reverse proxy
Extras
  * Twilio
  * sentry
  * Sendgrid
  * Makefiles for CLI Productivity
  * how I like to setup pycharm for local debugging  
  
Other blueprints/cookie-cutters
  * mention cookie cutter
  * pydanny
  * does awesome cookie-cutter exist?
  
Future considerations:
  * include a risk assessment for ISO 27001 / 27005 level applications
  * include ansible / cloud-init scripts for standing up the hosting server
  * 
  
Video / instructions on how to setup pycharms with screenshots

Patterns

  * Skip celery. Use a database and django commands as reliable, robust, and easily understood workers
    * their work would be idempotent, which means that repeat processes will not break things
