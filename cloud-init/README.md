# cloud-init

This folder holds the `cloud-init` files which will help
you to provision a new server with some of the cloud providers like
Scaleway or Digital ocean.

For my purposes it should:

  * update the base operating system
  * install docker
  * install ZeroTier and join my private network
  * install docker-compose
  * install other nice-to-haves for admin purposes
